# Arduino-ESP8266-NodeMCU
A collection of simple Arduino examples for using the NodeMCU (ESP8266) within the Arduino programming environment (IDE).

The code examples were created for an »Introduction to NodeMCU« Workshop, at the Retune Festival in 2018 (https://retunefestival.de).

If you are about to start with NodeMCU, we recommend you to start with the first example and go through them step by step, as the examples will become more advanced.

We also recommend checking out the following links to get you into it:

# Examples

## 01 Local Server
examples using the NodeMCU (ESP8622) as a local server to interact or display sensor data via basic html pages

### a_localServer_led
LED controlled by local Webpage (served by the ESP-Module itself)
![first example webpage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirg-io/Arduino-ESP8266-NodeMCU/master/images/example_01.png)

### b_localServer_led_hostName
LED controlled by local Webpage (served by the ESP-Module itself) + create hostname using mDNS (Multicast DNS)
![Serial-Console, host name example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirg-io/Arduino-ESP8266-NodeMCU/master/images/terminalExample_hostName.png)

### c_localServer_led_hostName_moreAdvancedServer
more advanced local web server running on the NodeMCU (ESP8266), still turning on the on-board LED, but the website looks better

### d_localServer_sensorValue
reading a light sensor (LDR) and displaying the value on a local Webpage (served by the ESP-Module it self). 

![LDR setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirg-io/Arduino-ESP8266-NodeMCU/master/images/LDR_setup.png)

Be aware: Input voltage range of bare ESP8266 is 0—1.0V. The operating Voltage is 3.3V. Therefore the NodeMCU (v1.0) has a voltage-divider circuit at Pin A0. If you have a different Board-Setup please check if you need to add the voltage divider circuit to your setup.

## 02 web example (easyIOT-cloud.com)   

EasyIotCloud https://easyiot-cloud.com/ is a free of charge IOT online plattform, offering an Arudino library to send and receive data tru an RestApi. EasyIOT-Could is very convenient for storing and displaying data, Remote controlling outputs,or being used as a bridge between an input and an output device.   

Further tutorials and guidance can be found here: https://iot-playground.com/build

You can dowload the arduino library here: https://iot-playground.com/blog/2-uncategorised/67-arduino-esp8266-ide


### a_EasyIotCloud_button
reading the onboard button input (D3 / GPIO 0) and sending »button pressed« to EasyIotCloud https://easyiot-cloud.com/ 

![easyIOT-cloud website showing a button recording](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirg-io/Arduino-ESP8266-NodeMCU/master/images/sampleData_button.png)

if you want to use an external button and led you can set it up as following:
